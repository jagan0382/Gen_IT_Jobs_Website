            Looking to recruit new talent without getting bogged down by the hassles of HR management? Employee leasing solutions may be your best choice to get new hires on board swiftly and painlessly.</p>
    
    <h3 class="heading">What is employee leasing?</h3>
            <p>When you started your business, you probably did not imagine that you would be spending time dealing with the administrative troubles of employee recruitment. You have a business to run - that's what you signed up for, not filing paperwork for every new employee that you hire.</p>
            <p>But these administrative and HR requirements are statutory and therefore unavoidable. Many business owners unfortunately find themselves spending way too much time grappling with these issues.</p>
            <p>Employee leasing solutions provide the perfect way out for busy entrepreneurs by taking over all the hiring responsibilities. Let us do the hard work of finding the right employees for you, so you can focus on the core task of running your business rather than dealing with administrative nitty-gritties such as running background checks.</p>
            <p>Employee leasing works by simply transferring employees from a company to the payroll of GEN IT Jobs's employee leasing services, and then releasing them back to the company on a temporary basis. This allows GEN IT Jobs Consulting to become the legal employer, thus taking over all HR management tasks.</p>
    
    <h3 class="heading">Leave your hiring woes to GEN IT Jobs Consulting</h3>
            <p>GEN IT Jobs Consulting is one of the leading staff augmentation services in India.

    <h3 class="heading">Employee leasing allows you to focus on your core business</h3>
            <p>Many small and medium-sized businesses do not have the luxury of in-house “departments” to handle payroll and hiring. That's why most of these companies turn to employee leasing companies that offer a wide range of services.</p>
            <p>Staff augmentation or employee leasing allows companies to attract and retain talented employees, and to get access to enhanced services such as insurance benefits, complete risk management, and even employee training and development.</p>
          
    <h3 class="heading">Is employee leasing the right choice for you?</h3>
            <p>Employee leasing is a popular, strategic choice of smart entrepreneurs all over the world. Your priority should be to focus on the business rather than bear the administrative burdens that come with it.</p>
            <p>GEN IT Jobs Consulting can help you figure out if employee leasing might be the best choice for your business. Request a consultation with us by filling out the contact form below.</p>
